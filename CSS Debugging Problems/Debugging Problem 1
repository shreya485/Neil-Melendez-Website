  <h2><strong>Early Life</strong></h2>
  <p>Neil Melendez has a sister, Gabrielle Melendez. At some point in his early life, a fall out of a tree resulted in his sister having a brain injury that left her disabled.
     Due to his family's lack of wealth, they were unable to pay for her medications or treatments so he took care of his sister by brushing her teeth, combing her hair, and helping her eat</p>
     <ul>
       <li>He recognized <a href="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/the-good-doctor/images/a/aa/505Promo17.jpg/revision/latest/smart/width/53/height/53?cb=20211118085734">Dr. Shaun Murphy's</a> skills, but at first wasn’t ready to take a chance on him, due in part to his general strict nature about work matters and also due to concerns about difficulties related to Murphy's autism</li>
       <li>Then, as time went on, Neil began to respect Shaun and allowed him to work in surgery, doing more than just suction.</li>
       <li> Notably, when Shaun faces discrimination from the parents of an autistic patient, Melendez sticks up for him, acknowledging how hard he has been on Shaun but recognizing that Shaun had proved him wrong to the point that he threatened to not do the surgery if Shaun couldn't be part of it. </li>
